        <p class="p2">Pokémon is a series of video games developed by Game Freak and published
            by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company as part of the Pokémon media franchise.
            Created by Satoshi Tajiri with assistance from Ken Sugimori,the first games released in 1996 in Japan for
            the Game Boy,
            and the main series of role-playing video games (RPGs), also referred as the &quot;core series&quot; by
            their developers</p>

                <h4>Water</h4>
                <p>
                    Water is one of the three basic elemental types along with Fire and Grass, which constitute the
                    three starter Pokémon.
                    This creates a simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to new players. Water is the most
                    common type with over 100 Pokémon
                    , which are based on a wide variety of fish and other sea-dwelling creatures.</p>

                    starter Pokémon.
                    This creates a simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to new players.
                    Fire types are notoriously rare in the early stages of the games so choosing the Fire variation
                    starter is often a plus.</p>

                    players.Grass is one of the weakest types statistically, with 5 defensive weaknesses and 7 types

                        We're sure you know this Electric mouse Pokemon, and you know it quite well. Basic knowledge
                        of Pikachu
                        is essential for every trainer, but you should also be well versed in the rodent's
                        evolutionary chain.
                        Pikachu, mighty as it is, has an even stronger evolved form also capable of generating vast
                        amounts of
                        electricity. Maybe you've bumped into this species in the wild. Either way, this is a
                        question all
                        Pokemon trainers should be able to answer.</li>

                        Not all Poke Balls are made equally. There's the basic model you start your journey off
                        with, but
                        progressive upgrades are needed if you're looking to keep up with some of the stronger wild
                        Pokemon
                        who emerge in later routes. If you've made your way through any Pokemon game, you've
                        reached the
                        point where you're presented with the most effective Poke Ball known to man. This is a one
                        shot
                        catch, and no button mashing at all is required.
